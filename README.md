# Point Breakers
Play as a demolitionist equipped with a grenade launcher and try to destroy everything and score as many points as possible before time runs out or enemies catch you

Main mechanics of the game:

Navigate through a tiered level with multiple structures waiting to be blown apart

Fire grenades at objects and do as much damage as possible

Avoid enemies waiting to shoot you right back

Utilizes Unreal Engine 5's Chaos Destruction to simulate realistic object breakage
